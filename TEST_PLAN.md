# Circuit Playground — Feature Test Plan

Goal: exercise every feature one at a time and record pass/fail. Each test states the
**setup**, the **expected result** (with a hand-calculated number where possible), and the
**watch-for** list: graphical glitches, model accuracy, model glitches (NaN / blow-ups /
non-convergence), conflicting settings, time-base changes, and runtime (while-running) changes.

Status legend: `[ ]` not run · `[P]` pass · `[F]` fail (link issue/notes) · `[S]` skipped

Recording: for every failure, capture `screenshots/<test-id>.bmp` (F12/Screenshot action)
and note: build hash, steps, expected vs actual, stderr excerpt.

## 0. Pre-flight (run before everything else)

| ID | Test | Expected |
|----|------|----------|
| 0.1 | `[ ]` Clean build (`rebuild.bat`) with `-Wall` — zero new warnings | Builds |
| 0.2 | `[ ]` Launch, empty canvas, idle 60 s | No stderr spam, stable FPS, no memory growth (Task Manager) |
| 0.3 | `[P]` Debug leftovers in the working tree | Removed 2026-08-24: all `[DC ANALYSIS]`/`[SOLVER]`/`[CLAMP]`/LED-array prints, the `probe_debug.log` and `oscillator_debug.txt` writers, and the `debug_circuit.json` auto-load block |
| 0.4 | `[P]` Repo hygiene | Stray `nul`, debug logs and scratch scripts deleted; `.gitignore` covers `*.log`, `screenshots/`, `circuit.json` |
| 0.6 | `[ ]` Headless regression: `build\tools\template_smoke.exe` (add `--verbose` for bias points, `--nodes` for net mapping) | Prints `47/47 templates passed`; run after every engine change |
| 0.7 | `[ ]` `template_smoke --probe-test` | 42/42: every template's designated output node matches the hand calculation (DC level, amplitude, peak or mean) |
| 0.8 | `[ ]` `template_smoke --osc-test` (also `--osc-dt 5e-6`) | Wien ~1.56 kHz and phase-shift ~6.0 kHz really oscillate, at dt from 100 ns to 5 us |
| 0.9 | `[ ]` `template_smoke --geom-test` | Schematic audit: 0 diagonal wires anywhere; remaining crossings / wires-through-bodies are listed per template (see TEMPLATE_AUDIT open items) |
| 0.10 | `[ ]` `template_smoke --flow-test`, `--scope-test` | 47/47 and 8/8 |
| 0.5 | `[ ]` Window resize to min size / maximized / 4K | Panels reflow, no overlapping text, neon border tracks edges |

---

## 1. Canvas & Editing (UI-only, sim stopped)

| ID | Test | Expected / Watch-for |
|----|------|----------------------|
| 1.1 | `[ ]` Place every component category via palette click → canvas | Ghost follows cursor, snaps to grid, symbol matches `SCHEMATIC_DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md` |
| 1.2 | `[ ]` Rotate `R` ×4 before placing and after placing (double-click) | Terminals stay on grid at all 4 angles; labels don't overlap body; no mirrored text |
| 1.3 | `[ ]` Wire tool: terminal→terminal, terminal→wire midpoint, wire→wire junction | Junction dot drawn, node count in status bar updates |
| 1.4 | `[ ]` Wire crossing without junction | No junction dot; nodes stay separate |
| 1.5 | `[ ]` Delete component with attached wires (Delete, Backspace, Delete tool) | Wires removed/dangling handled; no orphan node in status count |
| 1.6 | `[ ]` Undo/Redo across place, move, wire, delete, property edit, rotate (10 steps deep each way) | State exactly reversible; probes/scope channels survive undo |
| 1.7 | `[ ]` Copy/Cut/Paste/Duplicate single + multi-select | New IDs/labels unique (R1→R2), wires inside selection copied |
| 1.8 | `[ ]` Box select, Shift-add to selection, drag-move selection | Wires stretch, snap respected |
| 1.9 | `[ ]` Pan (middle drag, Shift+drag), zoom (wheel) at extremes | Grid still drawn at max zoom-out; text scales; no z-fighting of wires |
| 1.10 | `[ ]` Grid toggle `G`, snap toggle `S`, place with snap off then on | Off-grid component still wireable |
| 1.11 | `[ ]` Text annotation: size/bold/italic/underline, multi-line, empty | No clipped glyphs; empty text deletable |
| 1.12 | `[ ]` Palette collapse/expand all sections, scroll palette | Headers clickable at every scroll offset; every item in every section (incl. the new Sub-circuit / Bus section: Pin, IC, Bus, Tap, Lamp, and Measurement: VMeter, AMeter, WMeter, TstPt) places exactly that item; circuit buttons (sRLC, pRLC, Cmp, …) place the whole template — was broken by stale hit-boxes of unlisted items |
| 1.13 | `[ ]` Spotlight `Ctrl+K`: fuzzy query, arrow keys, Enter, mouse click, Esc | Every component in `types.h` reachable by search |
| 1.14 | `[ ]` Property panel: engineering notation `1k 4.7u 10n 2.2M 1p`, negative, `0`, garbage `abc`, empty | Correct parse; invalid input rejected without crash; value redisplayed in same notation |
| 1.15 | `[ ]` Property panel: scroll-wheel edit, keyboard shortcuts per guide §10 | Steps sane (1-2-5), clamps at limits |
| 1.16 | `[ ]` Resize panels (scope, properties) to min/max | Scope controls scroll with wheel when squeezed; nothing draws outside panel |
| 1.16a | `[ ]` Scope in-place resize: drag top edge up to just under the toolbar; drag left edge out to the palette; then resize the window; then pop out and back | Scope grows over properties list / canvas; clicks on the enlarged scope never place components underneath; size persists across window resize; corner ticks visible |
| 1.16b | `[ ]` Peak Detector & Clamper templates (sweeping sources) at 50 ms/div | Peak detector output rides the 1-5 V envelope (rises fast, decays with 47 ms bleed); clamper bottom stays at -0.7 V while the top follows twice the amplitude |
| 1.16c | `[ ]` Load any template | Probes appear on input (CH1) and output (CH2), scope time/div presets (e.g. 200 µs/div filters, 50 ms/div peak detector, 50 µs/div phase-shift), simulation auto-starts, status bar names the template; loading a second template adds its probes (max 8) |
| 1.16f | `[ ]` Scope mouse: wheel over the screen, Shift+wheel, middle-drag horizontally and vertically | Wheel steps time/div 1-2-5 and turns Trk off; Shift+wheel steps V/div; middle-drag slides the trigger position (0..1) and shifts channel offsets; wheel elsewhere still scrolls palette/properties/controls; canvas pan unaffected |
| 1.16e | `[ ]` `Trk` (sweep tracking) on the filter templates | time/div steps down 1-2-5 as f rises (2 ms/div at 100 Hz → 20 µs/div at 20 kHz) so ~3 cycles always show; no flicker between steps; toggling Trk off freezes time/div; V/div preset 0.5 V |
| 1.16d | `[ ]` RC LP / RC HP / RL / Sallen-Key / band-pass / notch templates | Source sweeps 100 Hz-20 kHz (notch 10-300 Hz) log, back and forth every 3 s; `f=` readout under the source updates live; LP output shrinks past 1.59 kHz, HP grows, notch vanishes at 60 Hz; dt auto-picks ~250 ns for the 20 kHz end; disabling the sweep in the source properties restores the static case |
| 1.17 | `[ ]` F1 shortcuts dialog | Matches README table; Esc closes |

---

## 2. Simulation Control & Time Base

Key numbers: `DEFAULT_TIME_STEP=1e-7`, range `1e-9 … 1e-2`, `MAX_HISTORY=10000`, decimation
kicks in above that span. Adaptive stepping is **disabled by default** (`adaptive_enabled=false`).

| ID | Test | Expected / Watch-for |
|----|------|----------------------|
| 2.1 | `[ ]` Run/Pause/Stop/Reset via toolbar and Space | Status bar time advances, pauses, resets to 0; reset re-runs DC op point |
| 2.2 | `[ ]` Step mode: single-step ×10 | Time advances exactly `dt` per step |
| 2.3 | `[ ]` Speed `+`/`-` 0.1× → 100× while running | No time jump backwards; particles speed up; UI stays responsive at 100× |
| 2.4 | `[ ]` Time step `dt` buttons through full 1n…10m table **while running** (RC circuit, 1 kHz) | Waveform continuous across change; no spike at the change instant; no NaN |
| 2.5 | `[ ]` Auto time-step button on: 1 Hz, 1 kHz, 1 MHz AC sources | Picks 50–300 samples/period; sanity-check reported dt |
| 2.6 | `[ ]` dt too large for the signal (10 ms dt, 1 kHz sine) | Aliasing visible but no crash; consider warning |
| 2.7 | `[ ]` dt tiny (1 ns) on 1 Hz signal for 30 s wall time | History decimation engages; scope still shows a full cycle at 1 s/div; RAM flat |
| 2.8 | `[ ]` Scope Time/div sweep 10 ns → 100 s while running and while paused | Range extended 2026-08-24 (was 1 µs floor). History decimation now follows time/div (span = 20×time/div), so the trace re-fills briefly after each change; labels show ns/us/ms/s. Below ~10 samples per division the trace is stepped — lower dt (Auto) for ns/div work |
| 2.9 | `[ ]` **Conflict:** time/div < dt (e.g. dt=10 µs, 1 µs/div) | Defined behaviour (flat/stepped trace), not garbage |
| 2.9a | `[ ]` **dt ↔ time/div sync** (automated: `template_smoke --scope-test`, must print all `OK`) | Changing time/div re-maps dt to ~50 samples/div, never coarser than the accuracy step (1 kHz source ⇒ 10 µs), snapped to 1‑2‑5: 1 ms/div→10 µs, 100 µs/div→2 µs, 1 µs/div→20 ns; **lower limit** 10 ns/div→1 ns (MIN_TIME_STEP); **upper limit** 100 s/div stays accuracy-limited (10 µs; DC-only circuit → 100 ns default), MAX_TIME_STEP 10 ms never exceeded |
| 2.9b | `[ ]` **Out of sync** (GUI): press dt `+`/`−` without touching time/div ⇒ manual dt kept; then change time/div ⇒ dt re-mapped and status bar says "Time step matched to scope"; history re-fills once, no stale spacing | Manual override survives until time/div changes |
| 2.10 | `[ ]` **Conflict:** time/div window > history span | Trace fills what exists; left edge not mirrored/garbage |
| 2.11 | `[ ]` Change component value while running (R, C, V, freq) | Sim absorbs change next step; no reset of time; capacitor state preserved (or documented reset) |
| 2.12 | `[ ]` Add/delete component/wire while running | Matrix rebuilt; no crash on node-count change; probes remapped correctly |
| 2.13 | `[ ]` Delete probed node while running | Channel goes flat/disabled, no read past history |
| 2.14 | `[ ]` Non-convergence case (two ideal voltage sources in parallel, different V; current source open) | Error message, sim halts cleanly, canvas still editable |
| 2.15 | `[ ]` Floating node (resistor with one end unconnected) | GMIN keeps solve stable; voltage shown ≈ 0 or sensible |
| 2.16 | `[ ]` No ground in circuit | Clear warning, no crash |
| 2.17 | `[ ]` Run 10 min continuous on Wien bridge | No drift/NaN; stderr not growing (see 0.3) |

---

## 3. Component Model Accuracy

Method: build the minimal circuit, probe, compare against hand calc. Tolerance ±2 % unless stated.
Also for **each** component: rotate 4× and verify terminal semantics don't change; save/load round-trip (§7).

| 3.2.8 | `[ ]` Photoresistor vs Lux slider 0→100 % live | R changes monotonic |
| 3.2.9 | `[ ]` Thermistor vs Temp slider −40→125 °C live; resistor tempco | Beta model matches formula at 25 °C and 85 °C |
| 3.2.10 | `[ ]` Fuse 1 A rating, drive 2 A | Blows, stays blown, Reset repairs |
| 3.2.11 | `[ ]` Transformer 10:1, center-tap | 120 Vac → 12 Vac; CT gives ±6 |

| 3.6.2 | `[ ]` Real op-amp rails ±15, input 2 V, gain −10 | Output clamps at −15. Saturation is now stamped as a rail voltage source inside Newton iteration (all three op-amp types), with the post-solve clamp kept as a safety net — a resistor load current must equal V/R using the clamped V, and no other node may exceed the rails |
| 3.6.3 | `[ ]` Real op-amp single supply 0–5 V, comparator | Clamps at 0 and 5; no overshoot below 0 |
| 3.6.4 | `[ ]` Real op-amp GBW, slew rate | 1 V/µs slew visible on step |

| 3.9.2 | `[ ]` LM317 R1=240, R2=720 | 5.0 V; TL431 ref 2.5 V |
| 3.9.3 | `[ ]` Lamp power/voltage; DC motor | Brightness scales; motor speed |
| 3.9.4 | `[ ]` LED array 8 seg: drive, per-segment burn-out, color cycle, **Reset repairs all** (new) | Segments light in order; failed stays dark until Reset |
| 3.9.5 | `[ ]` LED matrix 8×8 | Pattern from inputs |
| 3.9.6 | `[ ]` Voltmeter/Ammeter/Wattmeter/Test point in status bar | Match probe values; ammeter zero-ohm doesn't break solve |

---

## 4. Oscilloscope

Setup: AC 1 V 1 kHz + 2nd probe on divider output; square 500 Hz on CH3.

| ID | Test | Expected / Watch-for |
|----|------|----------------------|
| 4.1 | `[ ]` 8 probes, 8 colors, enable/disable each | Legend matches trace colours; disabled channel hides |
| 4.1a | `[ ]` **Stack** button (row 3) with 2–8 probes on the *same* node | Overlay: traces coincide. Stacked: one band per enabled channel with its own zero line, CHn tag in channel colour, 8 divisions per band; disabling a channel re-flows the bands; trigger level line drawn in the trigger channel's band; FFT/X-Y unaffected; pop-out window keeps the toggle |
| 4.2 | `[ ]` V/div 1 mV → 100 V | Y labels update; trace clipped at panel edge, not drawn over labels |
| 4.3 | `[ ]` Trigger Auto/Normal/Single, rising/falling/both, level slider, source per channel | Stable display; Normal with no crossing → holds last; Single re-arm |
| 4.4 | `[ ]` Trigger level above signal in Auto | Free-runs; in Normal freezes (no blank) |
| 4.5 | `[ ]` X-Y mode with sin/cos 1 kHz | Circle; with 2:1 freq Lissajous |
| 4.6 | `[ ]` Cursors: CUR cycles Off → **Wave** → **Screen** → Off | Wave: a/b vertical bars with square markers on the source (trigger-channel) trace; readout shows t and V at a and b, Δt, 1/Δt, ΔV, dV/dt and gated Vpp/mean/rms between the cursors — on a 1 kHz 1 Vpk sine, a at a peak and b at the next peak reads Δt 1 ms, 1/Δt 1 kHz, gated Vpp 2 V, rms 707 mV. Screen: two extra horizontal bars; dragging picks the nearest bar; V readouts follow the bar in the source channel's band (works in stacked view). Active cursor marked `*`. Keys: ←/→ nudge (Shift ×10, Ctrl ×0.1), ↑/↓ amplitude bar (Screen), Tab switch, L link (header shows LINK; dragging a keeps Δt), Home reset, 1–8 bind the active cursor to a channel (tags read a:1 / b:2 in channel colours; on an RC LP, a on CH1 and b on CH2 at the same t gives ΔV = the filter drop), 0 restores defaults. Readout survives time/div and V/div changes |
| 4.7 | `[ ]` Measurements Vpp/Vrms/Vavg/f/period/duty on sine and square | Sine: 2.0/0.707/0/1000/1ms/50 %; square 500 Hz |
| 4.8 | `[ ]` FFT on 1 kHz sine + THD/SNR; on square (odd harmonics) | Peak at 1 kHz; square harmonics 1/n |
| 4.9 | `[ ]` Math channels: all 10 ops; Divide by a channel crossing 0 | No Inf/NaN painting whole screen |
| 4.10 | `[ ]` Persistence on/off, Autoset | Decay looks right; Autoset picks sane scales for 1 mV and 100 V signals |
| 4.11 | `[ ]` Scope screenshot BMP; app screenshot action → `screenshots/` dir created | File valid |
| 4.12 | `[ ]` Pop-out window: open, resize, close, reopen, close app with it open | No crash; main scope resumes |
| 4.13 | `[ ]` **Conflict:** FFT + X-Y + cursors + persistence toggled together | Mutually exclusive modes handled |
| 4.14 | `[ ]` Scope while paused / stopped / after Reset | Trace freezes / clears predictably |

---

## 5. Analysis Tools

| ID | Test | Expected |
|----|------|----------|
| 5.1 | `[ ]` Bode on RC LPF, range 1 Hz–1 GHz | −3 dB @ fc, −20 dB/dec, phase −45° at fc; cursor readout |
| 5.2 | `[ ]` Bode on Sallen-Key / notch templates | Q and notch depth plausible |
| 5.3 | `[ ]` Bode with no AC source / no probe | Friendly error |
| 5.4 | `[ ]` Bode **while sim running** then resume | Transient state not corrupted |
| 5.5 | `[ ]` Monte Carlo 10 / 1000 iterations, tolerance 5 % on divider | Mean≈nominal, σ sane; UI responsive; cancel works |
| 5.6 | `[ ]` Parametric sweep | Steps applied, restored after |
| 5.7 | `[ ]` Data export CSV waveform + measurements | Opens in spreadsheet, column count = channels |

## 6. Current Flow Visualization

| 6.2 | `[ ]` Parallel branches 1k / 10k | Particle density/size proportional |
| 6.3 | `[ ]` Two sources facing each other | Flow toward lower V |
| 6.4 | `[ ]` AC source | Particles reverse each half-cycle |
| 6.5 | `[ ]` Zoom/pan while animating | Particles stay on wires |
| 6.6 | `[ ]` **Automated:** `template_smoke --flow-test` | All 47 templates: no NaN, two-terminal components conserve charge, KCL holds at every node between wire flows and terminal currents, series templates (RC/RL filters, divider) show identical \|I\| on every wire equal to the resistor current |
| 6.7 | `[ ]` RC High-Pass running, current view on | Particles flow on **every** wire including both resistor leads and the ground return; dot size/speed identical on wire, capacitor body and resistor body; direction reverses each half-cycle |
| 6.8 | `[ ]` Parallel branches (divider with a 2nd resistor across R2) | Branch particle speed/brightness differ by current; junction dot in = out |
| 6.9 | `[ ]` Sources | Inside a source particles run − → + (out of the + terminal); a reverse-connected second source shows the flow reversal |

---

## 7. File I/O (**probe save/load newly added — high priority**)

| ID | Test | Expected |
|----|------|----------|
| 7.1 | `[ ]` Save/Load `.ckt` with every component type placed once, 8 probes, math channels, text | Byte-identical re-save; probe channel/colour/label restored |
| 7.2 | `[ ]` Load a `.ckt` saved by v3.2.2 (no probe section) | Loads; no read past EOF |
| 7.3 | `[ ]` JSON save/load (`circuit.json`) round-trip; LED colour re-derives Vf | Same as binary |
| 7.4 | `[ ]` Load corrupt / truncated / wrong-extension file | Error dialog, current circuit intact |
| 7.5 | `[ ]` Auto-save fires; recover after kill | Backup loads |
| 7.6 | `[ ]` Load while running | Sim stops/resets cleanly |
| 7.7 | `[ ]` Unicode path / spaces in path (this repo is in `python scripts/`) | Works |

---

## 8. Templates (all 47)

See **`TEMPLATE_AUDIT.md`** — one block per template with hand-calculated nominal output,
value variations (applied before run *and* live), the ideal/realistic model matrix (M0–M4),
time-base checks, and save/load. Three templates are flagged as suspect from the BOM alone
(Common Source, Common Drain, Differential Pair — bias path may be blocked by the coupling
cap); the RC Phase-Shift Oscillator is new and uncommitted.

---

## 9. Subcircuits (WIP)

| ID | Test | Expected |
|----|------|----------|
| 9.1 | `[ ]` Pin markers → Ctrl+G → IC block created with named pins | Dialog pre-fills pins |
| 9.2 | `[ ]` Place IC block, wire it, run | Documented placeholder behaviour, no crash |
| 9.3 | `[ ]` Ctrl+G with no selection / no pins | Friendly message |

## 10. Environment & Cross-cutting Conflicts

| ID | Test | Expected |
|----|------|----------|
| 10.1 | `[ ]` Temp slider extremes with thermistor + tempco resistor + diode (Is(T)) | Monotonic, no NaN at −40/125 |
| 10.2 | `[ ]` Lux 0 % with photodiode in TIA template | No divide-by-zero |
| 10.3 | `[ ]` Speed 100× + dt 1 ns + 8 probes + FFT + persistence | Frame time acceptable; sim doesn't starve renderer |
| 10.4 | `[ ]` Undo a property change while running | Value reverts live |
| 10.5 | `[ ]` Reset while Bode/MC dialog open | Dialog closes or ignores; no dangling pointer |
| 10.6 | `[ ]` Delete op-amp during clamp step (delete while running) | No stale `voltage_var_idx` |

## Execution order (suggested)

1. §0 pre-flight — especially decide on the debug prints (0.3), they affect everything.
2. §1 editing → §2 sim/time-base (foundation for everything else).
3. §3.6 op-amps + §7 file I/O + §3.9.4 LED array (all touched by the uncommitted diff).
4. Remaining §3 components, §4 scope, §5 analysis, §6, §8 templates, §9, §10.

Commit after each section passes so bisecting stays cheap.
